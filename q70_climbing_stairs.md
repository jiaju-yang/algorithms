# Solutions

* Brute Force
    * Time complexity: $O(2^n)$
    * Space complexity: $O(n)$
* Memoization
    * Time complexity: $O(n)$
    * Space complexity: $O(n)$
* Optimized Memoization
    * Time complexity: $O(n)$
    * Space complexity: $O(1)$
* Linear Recursion(The interesting thing is that this solution is faster than Memoization. That is weird.)
    * Time complexity: $O(n)$
    * Space complexity: $O(1)$
